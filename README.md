# Poly API - Web Sample

Copyright (c) 2017 Google Inc. All rights reserved.

This is a sample project showing how to invoke the
[Poly API](https://developers.google.com/poly) from
a web app.

## How to run

I generated an API Key for the Poly API following the instructions in [the
developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/poly/develop).

Place the sample files at the root directory of your web server.
If you have Python installed, you can use the `SimpleHTTPServer` module
to serve a local directory for testing:

    cd /path/to/sample
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

These are the available samples:

* **basic-sample.html**. Shows how to load and display a single asset
  with known ID.

* **search-sample.html**. Shows how to search for assets and display them.

* **tiltbrush-sample.html**. Shows how to load and display a Tilt Brush sketch.
